# codeinplace
My final project for Stanford's Code in Place (Intro to Python) Course. It displays graphs for top 5 deaths by state and county. It also asks for user input to view data for specified states and counties.

This project uses data from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data. (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv)
